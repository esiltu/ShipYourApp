## 📥 Installation

To set up the project locally, you will need to install the necessary dependencies. This project uses Yarn as the package manager.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/esiltu/expo-firebase-auth
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

## 📈 Usage

This is a development build application, so you will need to make development builds for both iOS and Android manually.

1. Create a development build for iOS and Android:
    ```sh
    npx expo prebuild
    ```

2. The project uses a `.env` file for storing secret Firebase keys. Ensure you have your Firebase keys set up in the `.env` file with the following variables:
    ```env
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
